## Assignment which was asked for the final presentation

1. You can query the data given for assignment through the web app. Choose SQL and use the table name ABC_Retail_Fact_Table.
2. Upload the files I have sent for the assignment and submit them.
3. The data consists of a denormalized structure which can be normalized into 4 dimensions (employee_dim, order_dim, product_dim, customer_dim) and 1 fact table (order_fact). Check how these are created in the Star Schema.sql file.
4. We create another table called MyCube which is a subset of ABC data (check MyCube.sql for subquery)
5. OLAP_operators_MySQL.sql - These contain various OLAP operations that we will be asked during class, check it out.
