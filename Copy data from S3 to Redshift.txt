STEPS to COPY data from S3 to Amazon Redshift
---------------------------------------------
1. For accessing S3 Bucket from redshift, make the files public in S3
2. Add role to Redshift cluster that has S3 Read permissions
3. Go to query editor and create connection
4. Use following command in sql editor
CREATE TABLE departments
(
  department_id INT NOT NULL,
  department VARCHAR NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (department_id)
);

copy departments
from 's3://instacart-527-g2/departments.csv'
iam_role 'arn:aws:iam::034319748478:role/redshift-ec2-s3'
region 'us-east-1'
format as csv
IGNOREHEADER 1;

NOTE: 
1. Table should be created first.
2. Need to specify redshift resgion, role assigned to redshift, delimiter (csv in this case) and also ignoreheader if file has 1st line as column names.
