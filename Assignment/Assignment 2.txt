1- Download ABC_Retail_Fact_Table.txt (attached)
2- Upload ABC_Retail_Fact_Table.txt to MySQL or Redshift
3- Create a Star Schema data model for ABC_Retail_Fact_Table by creating lookup tables for the categorical columns (Dimensions).

4- Create MyCube table from the ABC_Retail_Fact_Table
select 
    year(OrderDate) as ThisYear
    ,[Order_ShipCountry] as Region
    ,[ProductName] as Product
    ,[Order_Amount] as Sales
into
    MyCube
from 
    BC_Retail_Fact_Table
where
    [Order_ShipCountry] in ('USA','Canada','UK')
    and [ProductName] in ('Chai','Tofu','Chocolade')

5- Run all the OLAP Operators (attached) against the newly created MyCube table

6- If your DBMS does not support PIVOT, write a SQL script to produce the same result 

You should upload all the related SQL scripts to Sakai before the deadline. You will be asked to show how your OLAP scripts work in class.
